###  What is the difference between a function and a method? [2p]
#### Your answer:
A method is used in a class and associated with an object and it's able to operate on data that is contained in the class.
A function is used and can be called by it's name. It's independent of an object

### What is the constructor? When it is used? [2p]
#### Your answer:
They initialize a newly created object. It is used when you create a new class. It must always take as its first argument a reference to the instance being constructed.
